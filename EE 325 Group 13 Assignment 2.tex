\section{Question 1 - (2-5)}
\label{Q1}
\textbf{2-5} Prove and generalize the following identity : \\
\begin{equation*}
	P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P(AC) - P(BC) + P(ABC)
\end{equation*}

\hspace{1em} \large{\textbf{SOLUTION :}} \\
We will use the following equation for the proof :
\begin{equation}
\label{(1)}
	P(A \cup B ) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)
\end{equation}
\begin{proof}
	Since $A \cup B \cup C = (A \cup B) \cup C$,  using \ref{(1)}, we can say that : \\ 
	\begin{align*}
		    P(A \cup B \cup C) &=P((A \cup B) \cup C) \\
		    &= P(A \cup B) + P(C) - P((A \cup B) \cap C)) &&\text{(using \ref{(1)})} \\
		    &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P((A \cup B) \cap C)) &&\text{(using \ref{(1)})} \\
		    &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P((A \cap C) \cup (B \cap C)) \\ &\text{(using distributive property of $\cap$ and $\cup$)} \\
		    &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - \left(P(A \cap C) + P(B \cap C) - P((A \cap C) \cap (B \cap C)) \right) \\ &\text{(using \ref{(1)})} \\
		    &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P(AC) - P(BC) + P(ABC) \\
		    & \text{Since}  (A \cap C) \cap (B \cap C) \equiv A \cap B \cap C  \text{(using distributive property of $\cap$)} 	
	 \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Question 2 - (2-10)}
\label{Q2}
\textbf{2-10} \textit{(Chain rule)} Show that  : \\
\begin{equation*}
	P(A_n \dots A_1) = P(A_n \mid A_{n-1} \dots A_1) \dots P(A_2 \mid A_1)P(A_1)
\end{equation*}

\hspace{1em} \large{\textbf{SOLUTION :}} \\
\textbf{Definition of Conditional Probability :}\\
For events A,B in the same probability space, such that $Pr(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of A given B is : \\
$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} ,
P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) \times P(B) $$

 
We shall prove this by induction on $n$ (number of events)\\
So, for the first case $ n = 1 $ \\
$$P(A_1) = P(A_1)$$
Which is trivially true. \\
For the inductive step, let $n > 1 and$ assume (the inductive hypothesis) that : \\
$$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1}) = P(A_1) \times P(A_2 \mid A_1) \times \dots P(A_{n-1} \mid (A_1) \cap (A_2) \dots (A_{n-2})) $$ \\
Now we can apply the definition of conditional probability to the two events $A_n$ and $(A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1})$ to deduce that : \\
\begin{align*}
	P(A_n \cap A_{n-1} \dots A_1) &= P((A_n) \cap (A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1})) \\
	&= P(A_n \mid (A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1})) \times P(A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1}) \\
	&= P(A_n \mid (A_1 \cap A_2 \dots A_{n-1})) \times P(A_1) \times P(A_2 \mid A_1) \\ &\times \dots P(A_{n-1} \mid (A_1) \cap (A_2) \dots (A_{n-2})) 
\end{align*}
where in the last line we have used the inductive hypothesis. This completes the proof by induction.

\label{Q16}
\textbf{16} \textbf{Extra credit}: 10\% of the surface area of a sphere is white and the rest is black. There are no assumptions on how this white part is distributed on the surface. Prove that it is always possible to inscribe a cube with all its vertices black. Think of a randomly inscribed cube. Let $A_i$ be the probability a random vertex is white. Now obtain an upper bound on the probability that at least one of the vertices is white. Show that this strictly less than one. This proves that there is at least one cube with all black vertices.
