\section{Question 7 - (2-24)}
\label{Q7}
\textbf{2-24}  Box 1 contains 1000 bulbs of which 10\% are defective. Box 2 contains 2000 bulbs of which 5\% are defective. Two bulbs are picked from a randomly selected box.

\section{Question 10}
\label{Q10}
\textbf{10} A course is taught by four instructors. Before every lecture, the instructors draw lots and one of them is randomly chosen to teach on that day.

\section{Question 12}
\label{Q12}
\textbf{12} $A$ and $B$ play the following game of dice. Both roll their dice. If $B$ rolls a one, then it rolls again and keeps whatever appears. The one with the highest value wins. If there is a tie $A$ wins. What is the probability that $A$ wins the game. : \\

\section{Question 13}
\label{Q13}
\textbf{13}There are $R$ brown balls and $B$ black balls in an urn. Balls are drawn at random without replacement. Let $A_k$ be the event that a brown ball is drawn for the first time on the $k$-th draw. Find $p_k$, the probability of $A_k$. Now consider the case when $B$ and $R$ are increased to $\infty$ while keeping $\alpha = R/(B + R).$ Find $p_k$ as $B + R \rightarrow \infty$. : \\

\section{Question 14}
\label{Q14}
\textbf{14} There are $n$ of which the $r$-th urn contains $r - 1$ brown balls and $n - r$ black balls. You pick an urn at random and pick two balls at random without replacement. What is the probability that the second ball is black. What is conditional probability that the second ball is black given that the first ball is black.  : \\

\section{Question 15}
\label{Q15}
\textbf{15} \textbf{Prosecutor’s fallacy} : Let $G$ be the probability that an accused is guilty, and $T$ that the testimony of a witness is true. Many times it is argued that $Prob (G \mid T) = Prob (T \mid G)$. Show that this is true iff $Prob (G) = Prob (T).$ : \\

\section{Question 16}
\label{Q16}
\textbf{16} \textbf{Extra credit}: 10\% of the surface area of a sphere is white and the rest is black. There are no assumptions on how this white part is distributed on the surface. Prove that it is always possible to inscribe a cube with all its vertices black. Think of a randomly inscribed cube. Let $A_i$ be the probability a random vertex is white. Now obtain an upper bound on the probability that at least one of the vertices is white. Show that this strictly less than one. This proves that there is at least one cube with all black vertices.
